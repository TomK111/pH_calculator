# pH Calculator
This is a simple program written in Python and uses Jupyter Notebook that calculates the pH balance of a solution by providing the concentration of hydrogen ions.

## How Does This Project Work?
- After cloning this repository, and running `jupyter notebook`, the user enters the total concentration of hydrogen ions into the terminal.
- Then, the program will calculate the pH balance and print a statement of whether the solution is acidic or basic

## Software/Tools Required
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook/Visual Studio Code
